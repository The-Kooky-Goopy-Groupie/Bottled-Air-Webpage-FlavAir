 I am always excited for my next box of flavored airs from my monthly subscription.
 The flavors they provide are unlike any I’ve seen from other bottled air companies.
 They are so unique in their fragrence and I am always sure that the air inside is as fresh as possible.
 Just this month I received a bottled air with the flavor of Ionosphere,
 meaning that the air was from the outer most layer of the atmosphere, basically space air,
 so unique! Plus it had such a great scent to it. Also when your done with your bottled air you
 can either rectcle the bottle straight back to the company or keep the bottle as a little honorary badge
 of all the types of air you’ve breathed in."
